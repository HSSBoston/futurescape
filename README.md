## Project Summary:

The FutureSpace Navigators is a team of four high school students. We worked on a wide range of data analytics to estimate the likelihood of certain weather conditions at a location and time with NASA EarthData.

#### (1) Estimating heat stress and risk in outdoor activities

#### (2) Estimating the pleasure and productivity of fishing

#### (3) Estimating the chances of weather-related pain and other symptoms

#### (4) Estimating the visibility of auroras
